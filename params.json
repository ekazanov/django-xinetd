It allows to use Django at\r\nlocalhost without webserver. The main goal is to use Django for local\r\nweb applications and do not spend time and computer resources when\r\nthese applications are not working.\r\n\r\n# Why yet another deployment way? #\r\n\r\nI want to use Django for local applications. It has pretty much all\r\nfeatures for it. Django can work without DB server, using SQLite. The\r\nweek place is websever. You can use separate webserver (Apache) or\r\ndevserver which is part of Django. Sometimes you have not got\r\nwebserver on computer. You can use devserver. But you need start a\r\nseparate process at startup for each of your applications in such\r\ncase. It takes time. It wastes resources.\r\n\r\n'django-xinetd' works using xinetd. xinetd listens a port. If it gets\r\na request, it starts django-xinetd script and passes the request to STDIN.\r\nSo when you do not need your applications they are not started.\r\n\r\n# System requirements #\r\n\r\n1. Linux (Script was tested with Ubuntu 12.04)\r\n1. Python (Script was tested with 2.7 version)\r\n1. xinetd\r\n1. Django (Script was tested with 1.4 version)\r\n\r\nIf xinetd is not installed, install it. This is Debian/Ubuntu command:\r\n\r\n`apt-get install xinetd`\r\n\r\n# Installation #\r\n\r\n## Script installation ##\r\n\r\n1. Copy django_xinetd.py file where you want to. Your project directory is a reasonably good place for it.\r\n1. Open script in your favorite text editor.\r\n1. Set shabang string to your python path. If you use your system \r\n   python it can be '/usr/bin/python'.\r\n1. Set DOCUMENT_ROOT variable to your document root.\r\n1. Set STATIC_FILES variable.\r\n1. Set PROJECT_PATH variable.\r\n1. Set LOGGING_NAME variable.\r\n1. Set DJANGO\\_SETTINGS\\_MODULE variable.\r\n\r\n# xinetd configuration #\r\n\r\nA configuration process is described for Ubuntu (It has to be the same\r\nfor Debian). The 9002 port is used.\r\n\r\n## /etc/xinetd/django_xinetd file ##\r\n\r\nCreate /etc/xinetd.d/django_xinetd file:\r\n\r\n    `service django_xinetd\r\n    {\r\n    \tdisable\t\t= no\r\n    \tsocket_type\t= stream\r\n    \tuser\t\t= <your user name>\r\n    \twait\t\t= no\r\n    \tport\t\t= 9002\r\n    \tprotocol\t= tcp\r\n    \tserver\t\t= /path/to/script/django_xinetd.py\r\n    }\r\n\r\n## /etc/services file ##\r\n\r\nAdd line to /etc/services file:\r\n\r\n`django_xinetd\t9002/tcp`\r\n\r\n## Restart xinetd ##\r\n\r\n`/etc/init.d/xinetd restart`\r\n\r\n# Usage #\r\n\r\nOpen http://localhost:9002 in your browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n"}
